This interactive sunburst allows you to change the proportions
of various quantities interactively.

Click on any of the outer slices of the charts to bring up an interactive
slider control for the size of the slice.

The D3 sunburst chart is bound to underlying JSON data, which has the following format:

<pre style="font-size: 8px;">
{
    "name": "root",
    "children": [
        {
            "name": "A",
            "children": [
                {
                    "magnitude": 20,
                    "name": "AW"
                },
                {
                    "magnitude": 5,
                    "name": "AX"
                },
                {
                    "magnitude": 10,
                    "name": "AY"
                },
                {
                    "magnitude": 50,
                    "name": "AZ"
                }
            ]
        },
        [...]
</pre>

This tree structure is rendered into the sunchart shown on the left 
by D3.

<br/>
<br/>

Clicking on an outermost element will show a slider input element,
and will bind that slider to the chart's underlying JSON data.
As the value bound to the slider changes, the chart is 
updated.
